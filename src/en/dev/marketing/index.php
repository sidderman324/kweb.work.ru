						<h2>Costs of Internet Marketing</h2>

						<p>With the expansion of the Russian Internet advertising market, there are plenty of options available at different prices. Therefore, there are often questions about budget distribution for Internet promotion: what specialists should be entrusted or is it better to form a marketing department to solve this issue? The most helpful solutions are listed below.</p>

						<h2>Comprehensive promotion on the Internet or individual services?</h2>

						<p>Before budget allocation, clearcut goals and objectives must be set, for example: whether you require a complete package plan, or maybe acquiring a separate service might suffice. Depending on your tasks, you need to select certain Internet marketing agencies.</p>

						<h3>Three categories of online advertising agencies:</h3>

						<ol>
							<li>The Internet marketing agency uses its own data and engages in the promotion, SEO, and development of websites in accordance with the terms and demands of the customer.</li>
							<li>Agencies in this category provide a full package of services: together with the customer they identify tasks and solve them with the help of all the tools of Internet marketing.</li>
							<li>These agencies include all of the previous features described above. The cost of the order for each client is different since everything is discussed individually. More detailed information is described in the following paragraphs.</li>
						</ol>

						<h2>How to understand the cost of advertising on the Internet?</h2>

						<p>Step 1.Correlate the cost with a possible end result</p>

						<p>Do not compare prices of various agencies, because the proposed prices will vary significantly. You should decide considering the possible outcome, ask yourself: "Can the agency help me achieve my goals? How quickly will I be able to recoup the cost of work? There is always a possibility that even an agency with a lower cost will not be able to provide sustainable results in the long run.</p>

						<p>Step 2 Do not forget that you need to take into account the possibility of additional work</p>

						<p>Each project may require additional, extraneous work that must be taken into account. Consequently, the cost of work should be set for the whole project, and not for each individual element or stage.</p>

						<p>Step 3 Do not "chase" after a cheap price</p>

						<p>For the development of your business quality is of utmost importance, the price should be considered after the quality: when choosing an agency, do not just pay attention to the prices they offer, but to the services offered and the quality of the services provided. For example, a full-service agency that is able to perform individual work tailored to your specific needs, and not simply perform the generally accepted "mouse clicks".</p>

						<p>Step 4 Since the development of strategies requires your investments, you should receive guarantees, namely a minimum six-month detailed forecast of the recoupment of your costs.</p>

						<h3>Advertising recoupment forecast</h3>

						<p>It is worth noting that the recoupment forecast does not require investment, for example, some agencies include this service in the development process and execute it immediately after the development of the strategy and compilation of the project mechanics.</p>

						<p>A reliable forecast includes several factors:</p>

						<ol>
							<li>A detailed analysis of potential customers, competitors, as well as demand.</li>
							<li>Market exploration.</li>
							<li>Gathering information about work in various departments: sales and service departments, call centres.</li>
						</ol>

						<p>These tasks will mainly be carried out by analysts who will need about 1-2 months to get it done, as well as requiring extra costs.</p>

						<p>It is worth noting that basically, if the agency offers you a free return on investment forecast, then most likely this service will lack in quality.</p>

						<h2>Cost of running an Internet marketing department</h2>

						<p>An Internet marketing department is engaged in promotion and marketing activities. Some create this department within their company in order to save spending on the services of Internet agencies, but is this an effective way?</p>

						<p>The average salary of employees in Internet marketing departments in Moscow:</p>

						<p>The salary of an Internet marketer: 89 470 rubles/month.<br>His responsibilities include compiling a detailed analysis of the target audience and competitors, the development of Internet marketing strategies, the coordination of the work of the department, the evaluation of advertising campaigns, as well as monitoring the emergence of new Internet marketing tools.</p>

						<p>The average salary for a Web analyst: 78 110 rubles/month.<br>His duties include the composition and adjustment of key performance indicators, the formation of client reports, the evaluation of the effectiveness of advertising.</p>

						<p>The average salary for an advertising specialist:63 950 rubles/month.<br>His duties include drafting a media plan, controlling and placing banners and being responsible for contextual advertising.</p>

						<p>The average salary for an SEO-optimizer 54 080 rubles/month.<br>His duties include: compiling a database of search queries, identifying errors in code optimization, tracking changes in algorithms of search engines.</p>

						<p>The average salary for a copywriter: 53 970 rubles/month.<br>His duties include: studying and analysing the target audience, writing SEO-optimized texts, editing texts on the website.</p>

						<p>The average salary for a designer: 72 570 rubles/month.<br>His duties include: creating prototype pages for the website, preparing graphics for a website, formatting images in accordance with the required standards.</p>

						<p>This is the main group of specialists required for the work of an Internet marketing department, but often additional specialists are required, and, consequently, new costs emerge. You will be required to create a workspace, buy licensed software and spend money on other investments as well. As a result, the cost of running an Internet marketing department for about 6 months or longer can run up to about 412,150 rubles without additional expenses.</p>
